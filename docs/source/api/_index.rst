The UML below shows the structure and core Python classes implemented in ``QSDsan``. Each class is represented by a box containing the class name (bold, top part of the box) with select data (middle part of the box) and method (end with parentheses, bottom part of the box) attributes. The ``Component`` and ``WasteStream`` classes in blue are inherited from the ``Chemical`` and ``Stream`` classes in `Thermosteam <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/thermosteam>`_ with the addition of wastewater-related attributes. The `Process` class in red enables dynamic simulation of Component objectsâ€™ transformation during kinetic processes (e.g., degradation of substrates). The ``SanUnit``, ``System``, ``TEA``, and ``Model`` classes in yellow are inherited from `BioSTEAM <https://github.com/BioSTEAMDevelopmentGroup/biosteam>`_ with added capacities for dynamic simulation and handling of construction inventories. Green boxes including ``ImpactItem``, ``ImpactIndicator``, and ``LCA`` are implemented in ``QSDsan`` to enable LCA functionalities.
